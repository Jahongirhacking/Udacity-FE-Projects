# How to use
* You can write zip code which you want on "enter the zipcode" input
* if the zip code is not found then try another one
* Don't forget to share your feelings

# Technologies used in the project
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node JS
* Express

## Adding new features or fixing bugs
* DOMContentLoaded: **87 ms**
* I changed some colours and created my own design
* I put some information not only date,temp,content but also zip code, state, country
* I was not able to upload the `node modules` due to 100 files limit on github, so you could use this app by installing `express`, `body-parser`, `cors`
